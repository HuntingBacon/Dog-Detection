# Dog-Detection
I created this code for a Nvidia coding camp and I had an idea of what to do.
I know from exerpience that dogs may not allways bark when they want to come in, so I figured I could create a program which would let me know when they are at the door.
Now some aspects of the dream where not able to be done due to the machine not reconizing the program needed to play sound, but I could at least have it print it out.
Then came the testing phase which showed it could work. Since the code was running detectnet it already had a dog class id, so I was able to use it for the detections.
It proved it could work with the code even though it was not the most accurate, but some of that could come from it being in dark conditions. 
This is in my mind proven when it worked with a picture of my dog on my phone. The first attempt before the code was fixed did not work, but after edits to the code were added.
It started to work. It did not completly work, but I think that comes from the fact that the dog was under the desk and that has bad lighting conditions.
With better lighting conditions and a better camera the results would most likly be more effective.
